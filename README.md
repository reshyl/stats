# Simple Stats
 A fairly simple but modular RPG-like Stats system for Unity. Created mostly for myself to easily integrate a stats system into my projects.
 
 **Features**
 
 * A Modifier system to easily add buffs/debuffs to Stats
 * Attributes to keep track of frequently changing properties like health, stamina etc.
 * Custom fields to easily reference Stats/Attributes
 
 **Installation**
 
 Make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your system. A git GUI such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) will do as well. We won't actually use Git, but it's still required for the coming steps to work.
 
 1. Open the Package Manager from **Window -> Package Manager**
 1. Click the **"+"** icon on the top left and select **Add package from git URL...**
 1. Paste https://github.com/reshyl/stats.git into the URL field and press enter
 
 **Quickstart**
 
 Nothing as of yet. I'll create the documentation for the full package if anyone besides me actually wants to use it.
 
 **Support**
 
 I don't expect anyone to use this besides me but most of the code is still documented. If you do need any help, feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/reshylDev).

**Third-Party Notices**

No third-party tools are used, or are required to run this package. I'd still like to give some credits:

* The initial idea was taken from [this thread](https://forum.unity.com/threads/tutorial-character-stats-aka-attributes-system.504095/) by [Kryzarel](https://www.youtube.com/c/kryzarel) and that serves as the inspiration for the system.
* Some design inspiration taken from [Fluid Stats System](https://github.com/ashblue/fluid-stats) and [Stats 2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/stats-2-game-creator-2-by-catsoft-works-206959). No code was taken from either system.
